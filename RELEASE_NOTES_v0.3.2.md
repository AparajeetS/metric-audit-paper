# mbe-eval v0.3.2

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/mbe-eval/0.3.2/

This release is the grant-readiness and public-consistency release for MBE.

## Highlights

- states the novelty boundary without claiming priority for partial
  correlation or hyperparameter conditioning;
- publishes the exact minimum matrix of 240 image and 100 causally masked text
  runs as 68 configuration blocks with five seeds each;
- adds the protected-holdout, independent-replication, conflict, discrepancy,
  and public-spend rules;
- keeps the 680-row legacy pilot explicitly exploratory and records its
  repeated configurations and invalid text setup;
- aligns the package description, repository links, author metadata, release
  tag, wheel, and source archive with the same restrained scientific position.

There are no API-breaking changes from v0.3.1.

## Validation

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
