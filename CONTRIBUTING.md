# Contributing

This is an active research repository. The most useful contributions are
reproducible audits, clearer documentation, and careful negative results.

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval.git
cd marginal-baseline-eval
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -q
```

## Run The Demo

```bash
mbe-eval-demo --bootstrap 200
```

## Audit Your Own CSV

Your CSV should contain one row per trained model/run, one held-out target, one
or more metric columns, and control columns such as learning rate, optimizer,
architecture, and task. Treat seeds as repeated observations or grouping units,
not as an ordered numeric covariate.

```bash
mbe-eval-audit \
  --csv runs.csv \
  --metrics fim_norm,val_loss,grad_norm \
  --target final_acc \
  --controls lr,wd,optimizer,arch \
  --groupby task \
  --output audit_report.md
```

## Experiment Contributions

For new experiment results, include:

- raw CSV or a stable artifact reference;
- exact command used to generate the result;
- metric list;
- control set;
- seed/config grid;
- summary CSV and markdown table;
- checksums for raw artifacts if practical.

Do not change metric lists, thresholds, or control sets after seeing results
unless the change is explicitly labeled exploratory.

New confirmatory experiments must follow the active
[`docs/MBE_2_RESEARCH_PROGRAM.md`](docs/MBE_2_RESEARCH_PROGRAM.md), not the
legacy v1 protocol.

## Pull Requests

- Keep research claims proportional to the design and uncertainty.
- Add tests for package behavior and a reproduction command for analyses.
- Do not commit credentials, private datasets, or machine-specific paths.
- Explain whether a change is exploratory, confirmatory, or software-only.
- Confirm `python -m pytest -q` and `python -m build` pass locally.

## Documentation Contributions

Keep claims scoped:

- say "washout under this control set" rather than "metric is useless";
- separate default MBE from strict validation-loss MBE;
- report random/control metrics;
- include uncertainty where available.
