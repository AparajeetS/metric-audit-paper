# mbe-eval v0.3.1

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/mbe-eval/0.3.1/

This release aligns the installable package and its PyPI page with the current
public research position.

## Scientific Positioning

- Labels the 680-row v1 ledger as exploratory rather than confirmatory.
- Records the repeated-configuration problem and invalid legacy text setup.
- Replaces universal metric-failure language with scoped, protocol-sensitive
  conclusions.
- Distinguishes the stable v1 linear partial-rank implementation from the MBE
  2.0 research design, which is not yet fully implemented or validated.
- States the novelty boundary: MBE does not claim priority for partial
  correlation or hyperparameter conditioning individually.

## Project Metadata

- Updates the author email and all project links.
- Points installation, source, issue, documentation, evidence, and notebook
  links to the renamed `marginal-baseline-eval` project.
- Keeps the lightweight core dependency set and optional PyTorch extras.

## Grant-Readiness Documentation

- Adds an exact 340-run factorial matrix: 240 image and 100 causal-text runs.
- Adds a protected-holdout and independent-replication protocol.
- Adds gated budget ceilings, public deliverables, and a final spend ledger.

## Validation

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```
