# Supporting Evidence

This file records the evidence accumulated so far for Marginal Baseline
Evaluation (MBE) and the FIM_norm case study.

Definitions used below:

- `washout`: a metric had meaningful raw association but its MBE partial
  correlation collapsed below the washout threshold.
- `sign-inversion` / `reverse-inversion`: the controlled association flipped
  direction. These are not counted as washout, but they are stronger audit
  warnings.
- `hidden-after-control`: weak raw association became meaningful only after
  controls. This can indicate masking by baseline/design variables.
- `survives`: the metric retained meaningful association after MBE controls.

The current evidence suggests a selective audit story: MBE does not kill all
metrics. It weakens, washes out, or inverts some fragile proxies while leaving
several validation, confidence/logit, gradient/Fisher magnitude, and
task-proximal metrics intact.

## 1. Normal FIM_norm Validation Before MBE

Source notes:

- `experiments/06_independent_audit/fim_norm_normal_eval.md`
- `experiments/06_independent_audit/jmlr_fim_norm_tests.md`

These are conventional metric-evaluation checks, not MBE checks.

| Run / evidence | Main result | What it suggests | Washout metrics |
|---|---|---|---|
| MLP dual acid test | Label-noise probe: FIM_norm vs accuracy `rho=-0.770`, `p=3.41e-03`; data-capacity probe: `rho=-0.937`, `p=6.99e-06` | FIM_norm looked strong under normal metric validation; lower FIM_norm tracked better generalization across two controlled stress directions. | Not applicable: no MBE controls in this run |
| Condition means | FIM_norm increased monotonically with label noise and decreased with more training data, while accuracy moved in the expected opposite direction | The metric had visually clean and statistically plausible behavior before MBE. | Not applicable |
| CNN + BatchNorm transfer | Noise probe `rho=-0.956`, n-train probe `rho=-0.837` | FIM_norm transferred beyond MLPs and survived BatchNorm settings under ordinary evaluation. | Not applicable |
| Transformer + LayerNorm transfer | Noise probe had correct sign but was not significant; n-train probe `rho=-0.951` | FIM_norm had partial architecture-transfer evidence, with weaker noise evidence on transformer. | Not applicable |
| Baseline metric comparison | FIM_norm, trace_norm, stable_rank_n, grad_norm, and weight_norm all looked strong in raw tests | FIM_norm was not obviously bad; it belonged to a plausible gradient-energy family. | Not applicable |
| Bootstrap checks | MLP and CNN FIM_norm CIs often excluded zero | The raw signal was not just a single point-estimate artifact. | Not applicable |

Interpretation:

FIM_norm passed enough conventional checks to motivate a metric paper. That is
why it is useful as a case study: MBE did not break a straw metric; it broke a
metric that looked credible under normal validation.

## 2. Early Loss-Controlled Falsification

Source:

- `experiments/06_independent_audit/fim_norm_normal_eval.md`

| Run / evidence | Main result | What it suggests | Washout metrics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Epoch-20 FIM_norm vs validation-loss control | Raw FIM_norm vs accuracy `rho=-0.514`; validation loss vs accuracy `rho=-0.924`; FIM_norm controlling validation loss `partial=+0.216`, `p=0.25`; validation loss controlling FIM_norm remained strong at `partial=-0.900`, `p=1.3e-11` | Much of FIM_norm's apparent signal was already explained by validation loss. | FIM_norm |

Interpretation:

This was the first clean hint that the FIM_norm signal might be derivative of
simpler training-state quantities.

## 3. Independent Artifact Audit

Source:

- `experiments/06_independent_audit/artifact_audit_report.md`

These audits recomputed rank-based correlations directly from saved CSV
artifacts.

| Run | Rows | Main result | What it suggests | Washout metrics |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `mlp_large_grid_v3_asam` | 1000 | FIM_norm `-0.815 -> +0.033`; weight_norm `+0.814 -> -0.034`; sam_sharpness and grad_norm inverted | In a large heterogeneous MLP grid, FIM_norm and weight norm collapsed after controls; several sharpness/gradient quantities were control-sensitive. | FIM_norm, weight_norm |
| `mlp_unified_grid_current` | 1000 | FIM_norm `-0.803 -> +0.056`; weight_norm `+0.808 -> -0.057`; sam_sharpness and grad_norm inverted | The FIM_norm washout replicated in the newer unified MLP grid. | FIM_norm, weight_norm |
| `cnn_kaggle_local_50` | 50 | FIM_norm `+0.376 -> +0.445`; val_loss `-0.892 -> -0.513`; most metrics survived | Tiny local CPU CNN run was useful for plumbing, but too small/undertrained to support paper claims. It did not reproduce FIM_norm washout. | None in the audit report |
| `cnn_kaggle_download_250` | 250 | FIM_norm `-0.051 -> -0.069`; val_loss `-0.095 -> -0.049`; most raw correlations were already weak | In a larger CIFAR-10 CNN grid, the metrics showed little robust signal; FIM_norm was weak and washed out. | asam_sharpness, weight_norm, FIM_norm, val_loss |

Interpretation:

The large MLP grids strongly support the "normal metric signal can wash out
under controls" story. The 50-row CNN run should be treated only as an
engineering smoke test. The 250-row CIFAR run suggests that naive CNN-grid
metric correlations can be noisy or weak unless the design is scaled and
controlled carefully.

## 4. ResNet CPU Smoke Tests

Sources:

- `experiments/06_independent_audit/resnet_fim_mbe_quick_report.md`
- `experiments/06_independent_audit/resnet_fim_mbe_standard_report.md`

| Run | Rows | Main result | What it suggests | Washout metrics |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| ResNet quick smoke | 8 | FIM_norm `-0.703 -> -0.858`; val_loss `-0.788 -> -0.880`; train_acc `+0.795 -> +0.889` | Plumbing worked; all reported metrics retained or strengthened signal, but n=8 is not evidence-scale. | None |
| ResNet standard smoke | 18 | FIM_norm `-0.146 -> +0.418` with lr+wd controls and `+0.368` with lr+wd+seed; val_loss, train_acc, train_loss survived | The run shows FIM_norm can be unstable even in ResNet plumbing, but this is still too small for a publication claim. | None by threshold table; FIM_norm shows sign instability from weak raw signal |

Interpretation:

These runs validate code paths and show why larger image-scale runs were
needed. They should not be used as central claims.

## 5. Kaggle-Scale JMLR Runs

- `experiments/07_jmlr_scale/jmlr_full_confirmed_680_strict_loss_mbe_summary.csv`

The default JMLR-scale MBE controls are:

```text
lr, wd, dropout, optimizer, arch, task, seed
```

Strict audits additionally control:

```text
val_loss
```

### FIM_norm Across the Main Confirmed Pool

| Audit | n | Raw rho | MBE partial rho | Class |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Image only, default controls | 480 | -0.662 | -0.218 | survives |
| Image only, strict + val_loss | 480 | -0.662 | -0.383 | survives |
| Text only, default controls | 200 | -0.291 | +0.014 | washout |
| Text only, strict + val_loss | 200 | -0.291 | +0.188 | weak-or-mixed |
| Full 680, default controls | 680 | +0.225 | -0.203 | reverse-inversion |
| Full 680, strict + val_loss | 680 | +0.225 | -0.300 | reverse-inversion |

Interpretation:

FIM_norm is not simply bad everywhere. It survives in image-only pooled audits,
washes out in text-only default audits, and reverses in the full image+text
pool. That is a stronger story than "FIM_norm fails": the result is
task-dependent and pooling-sensitive, exactly the kind of issue MBE is meant to
surface.

## 6. Metrics That Wash Out Most Often

Across the major MBE artifacts, the metrics most often appearing in washout
lists are:

- FIM_norm / fim_erank / fisher_entropy in text or mixed strict settings.
- weight norms: weight_l1, weight_l2, weight_rms, weight_linf.
- distance/update proxies: distance_from_init_l2, relative_distance_from_init,
  update_to_weight_ratio.
- feature metrics: feature_erank, feature_norm_mean, feature_cosine_mean.
- some sharpness and noise-scale metrics: sam_sharpness, asam_sharpness,
  grad_noise_scale, hessian_trace_hutchinson.
- some task-proximal metrics in text strict audits: confidence_mean,
  margin_mean, logit_norm_mean, metric_batch_acc, metric_batch_loss.

This does not mean each metric is universally useless. The repeated pattern is
that several metric families depend heavily on task, architecture, pooling, and
baseline controls.

## 7. Metrics That Repeatedly Survive

The full confirmed 680-model strict audit is the best current test of whether
MBE is selective. In that run, many metrics survived despite strong controls:

- fisher_trace
- fisher_spectral
- fisher_condition
- grad_norm
- grad_l1
- grad_linf
- grad_mean_abs
- per_sample_grad_norm_mean
- per_sample_grad_norm_std
- hessian_trace_hutchinson
- hessian_top_eig_power
- weight_linf
- weight_rms
- distance_from_init_l2
- relative_distance_from_init
- update_to_weight_ratio
- train_loss
- train_acc
- confidence_mean
- entropy_mean
- margin_mean
- brier
- ece
- logit_norm_mean
- metric_batch_acc
- metric_batch_loss

Interpretation:

This is important for the paper. MBE is not an indiscriminate metric destroyer.
It can preserve strong signals while flagging fragile ones.

## 8. Overall Narrative Supported So Far

The evidence supports this narrative:

1. FIM_norm looked publishable under ordinary metric evaluation.
2. Loss-controlled and hyperparameter-controlled audits broke much of its
   apparent independent signal.
3. Larger Kaggle-scale audits show that FIM_norm behavior is task-dependent:
   image-only results can survive, text-only results can wash out, and pooled
   image+text results can reverse.
4. MBE also flags other fragile metrics, especially feature-rank, weight-norm,
   distance/update, and some sharpness/noise-scale proxies.
5. MBE preserves many metrics, especially validation/task-proximal,
   confidence/logit, and several gradient/Fisher magnitude metrics.

The strongest current claim is:

> Raw pooled correlation is not enough to validate a generalization metric.
> Marginal Baseline Evaluation exposes whether the metric has signal beyond
> ordinary training baselines and design variables.

## 9. Evidence Gaps Before Submission

The current evidence is strong enough to guide the paper direction, but not yet
enough to freeze a JMLR submission. Remaining needs:

- bootstrap confidence intervals for all headline correlations;
- a locked holdout replication with no post-hoc narrative tuning;
- threshold-sensitivity tables for washout/survival labels;
- ablations over control sets: none, hyperparameters only, hyperparameters plus
  architecture/task, and strict + validation loss;
- a cleaned metric taxonomy table;
- a reproducibility page with commands and artifact hashes.

## 10. No-Compute Addendum

After the initial evidence ledger, a CPU-only uncertainty pass was added:

- script: `experiments/07_jmlr_scale/no_compute_uncertainty.py`
- report: `experiments/07_jmlr_scale/no_compute_outputs/NO_COMPUTE_UNCERTAINTY.md`
- bootstrap resamples: 200
- bootstrap unit: row/model run

Headline checks:

- full 680 default FIM_norm: raw `+0.225 [+0.136, +0.314]`, MBE partial `-0.203 [-0.267, -0.117]`, reverse-inversion;
- full 680 strict FIM_norm: raw `+0.225 [+0.138, +0.296]`, MBE partial `-0.300 [-0.389, -0.217]`, reverse-inversion;
- full 680 default random metric: raw and partial CIs overlap zero, weak-or-mixed;
- full 680 strict confidence_mean: raw and partial CIs stay positive, survives.

This strengthens the current narrative without new training compute: the
headline FIM_norm pooled reversal is not just a point-estimate artifact, while
the negative control remains weak and a positive confidence metric survives.
