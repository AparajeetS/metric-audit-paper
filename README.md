**Marginal Baseline Evaluation (MBE)** is an audit protocol for testing whether
machine-learning training metrics still predict held-out performance after
controlling for ordinary baselines such as learning rate, weight decay,
optimizer, architecture, task, and training-state measurements.

The project started from a concrete failure mode: a proposed metric can look
promising under raw pooled correlation while actually tracking easier baselines,
training loss, architecture mix, or other design variables. MBE makes that
failure visible by comparing raw association against controlled partial
rank-correlation.

## Current Status

This is an active research direction with an accompanying Python package,
Kaggle-scale experiment artifacts, and a public walkthrough notebook.

**Software status:** `mbe-eval` v0.3.2 implements the stable MBE v1
partial-rank audit. MBE 2.0 is the active research design and is not yet fully
implemented or empirically validated. See the [open research inventory](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/OPEN_RESEARCH.md)
for a precise map of what is available now.

The current direction is **MBE 2.0**, a multi-environment metric-validation
framework that separates unconditional association, incremental information,
transport, intervention response, and measurement reliability. The technical
[research program](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/docs/MBE_2_RESEARCH_PROGRAM.md), gated [JMLR roadmap](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/docs/JMLR_MILESTONE_ROADMAP.md),
and [compute plan](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/docs/COMPUTE_AND_COST_PLAN.md) are the source of truth for new work.

### Experimental Benchmark Audit Prototype

The repository now includes an experimental prototype for testing whether
selected E0-E2 checks from the candidate MBE 2.0 design transfer to AI
benchmark audits. It accepts a candidate metric, an external target, declared
baseline or capability-proxy columns, an environment, and a configuration-unit
identifier, then produces a scoped claim card. E3 matched interventions and E4
measurement-reliability checks are explicitly omitted.

```bash
mbe-eval-claim --csv benchmark_results.csv \
  --metric truthfulness_score --target external_criterion \
  --baselines capability_proxy,format_score \
  --environment benchmark_family --unit config_unit \
  --claim-text "The score adds held-out information beyond the declared proxies" \
  --output-prefix claim_card
```

Claim cards report a **Predeclared test outcome** rather than a benchmark
verdict. To make specification disagreement inspectable, run named alternatives
against the same rows and keep the resulting contestation bundle:

```python
from mbe_eval import compare_benchmark_claim_specs

bundle = compare_benchmark_claim_specs(
    benchmark_results,
    {
        "declared": {"baselines": ["capability_proxy"]},
        "expanded-baseline": {
            "baselines": ["capability_proxy", "format_score"]
        },
    },
    common={
        "metric": "truthfulness_score",
        "target": "external_criterion",
        "environment": "benchmark_family",
        "unit": "config_unit",
        "min_relative_mse_improvement": 0.01,
        "min_transport_relative_mse_improvement": 0.01,
        "bootstrap": 200,
    },
)
print(bundle["conclusion_changed"])
```

The bundle retains each complete claim card and identifies which named
specifications change the overall or per-estimand evidence states. It does not
select a preferred specification.

Run the included deterministic deceptive-control self-check with:

```bash
mbe-eval-claim-demo
```

This is a working research prototype, not an independently validated evaluator.
It does not certify benchmarks or models, establish causality or construct
validity, or show that declared baselines and proxies exhaust general capability.
The deceptive synthetic control checks expected behavior under one known trap;
passing it is not external validation. Stable `mbe-eval` v0.3.2 and the exploratory
680-row legacy ledger establish feasibility only; the ledger contains repeated
configurations and a legacy text setup with label leakage. See the full
[scope, input contract, conformance table, and claim limits](docs/BENCHMARK_AUDIT_PROTOTYPE.md).

MBE does not claim that partial correlation or hyperparameter conditioning is
new. The proposed contribution is their calibrated integration with a baseline
information ladder, five explicit estimands, deliberately deceptive controls,
configuration-blocked uncertainty, environment transport, matched
interventions, measurement reliability, and scoped metric claim cards. This
novelty claim must pass the public-corpus comparison gate or be narrowed.

## Legacy Pilot Evidence

The existing **680-row pilot ledger** is exploratory evidence, not a
submission-grade independent model sample. It includes repeated configurations,
and the text experiment lacks a causal attention mask and permits label leakage.
Its results motivate the new protocol but must not support confirmatory claims.

The minimum corrected scale design is explicit: 240 image runs
(`2 datasets x 3 architectures x 8 configurations x 5 seeds`) plus 100
causally masked text runs
(`1 dataset x 2 model sizes x 10 configurations x 5 seeds`). The 340 total is
a blocked factorial design, not a claim of 340 independent observations. See
[GRANT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/GRANT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md).

The ledger contains:

- 480 CIFAR-10 image models across CNN, ResNet, ViT, and WideResNet settings.
- 200 character-transformer language models.
- 40+ candidate metrics including gradient/Fisher metrics, feature metrics,
  confidence/calibration metrics, sharpness metrics, weight norms, and
  distance/update proxies.

## What The Evidence Suggests

The current Kaggle-scale runs support a selective audit story:

- MBE is selective rather than indiscriminate; many metrics retain signal under the declared controls.
- Several validation, confidence/logit, gradient/Fisher magnitude, and
  task-proximal metrics survive.
- Several feature-rank, weight-norm, distance/update, and sharpness/noise-scale
  metrics weaken, wash out, or invert under controls.
- FIM_norm is the motivating case study: it looked promising under conventional
  metric validation, then became task-dependent under MBE.

FIM_norm summary from the legacy pilot pool:

| Audit | n | Raw rho | MBE partial rho | Class |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Image only, default controls | 480 | -0.662 | -0.218 | survives |
| Image only, strict + validation loss | 480 | -0.662 | -0.383 | survives |
| Text only, default controls | 200 | -0.291 | +0.014 | washout |
| Text only, strict + validation loss | 200 | -0.291 | +0.188 | weak-or-mixed |
| Full image+text pool, default controls | 680 | +0.225 | -0.203 | reverse-inversion |
| Full image+text pool, strict + validation loss | 680 | +0.225 | -0.300 | reverse-inversion |

Full result tables and interpretation are in
[SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE.md](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE.md).
CPU-only bootstrap confidence intervals and threshold sensitivity are summarized
in the no-compute uncertainty report listed from the reproducibility guide.

## Install

```bash
pip install mbe-eval
```

Supported Python versions are 3.9 and newer; CI currently exercises 3.9, 3.11,
3.13, and 3.14.

Optional FIM_norm extraction utilities require PyTorch:

```bash
pip install "mbe-eval[torch]"
```

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval.git
cd marginal-baseline-eval
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Try It In One Command

After installation:

```bash
mbe-eval-demo --bootstrap 200
```

This runs a CPU-only synthetic audit, prints the MBE table, and writes
`mbe_demo_report.md`. The demo is intentionally small; replace the synthetic
dataframe with your training-run ledger for real experiments.
Use `--no-output` if you only want the printed table.

To audit your own CSV ledger:

```bash
mbe-eval-audit \
  --csv runs.csv \
  --metrics fim_norm,val_loss_ep20,grad_norm \
  --target test_accuracy \
  --controls learning_rate,weight_decay,optimizer,arch \
  --groupby task \
  --bootstrap 200 \
  --output audit_report.md
```

## Basic API

```python
import pandas as pd
from mbe_eval import audit_metrics, audit_report_markdown

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "fim_norm": [0.42, 0.51, 0.37, 0.65, 0.62, 0.35],
        "val_loss_ep20": [1.2, 0.9, 1.4, 0.7, 0.8, 1.5],
        "learning_rate": [1e-3, 1e-3, 3e-4, 3e-4, 1e-4, 1e-4],
        "arch": ["cnn", "cnn", "resnet", "resnet", "vit", "vit"],
        "test_accuracy": [0.71, 0.78, 0.68, 0.82, 0.80, 0.66],
    }
)

report = audit_metrics(
    df,
    metrics=["fim_norm", "val_loss_ep20"],
    target="test_accuracy",
    controls=["learning_rate", "arch"],
    bootstrap=100,
)

print(report[["metric", "raw_r", "partial_r", "classification"]])
print(audit_report_markdown(report, target="test_accuracy", controls=["learning_rate", "arch"]))
```

Your dataframe should have one row per trained model/run, one held-out target,
candidate metric columns, and baseline/design columns to control.

## Reproduce Current Tables

The main paper-scale audit can be regenerated from saved result CSVs. See
[REPRODUCIBILITY.md](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) for the exact legacy artifact command.

The public notebook source lives in:

```bash
kaggle/mbe_metric_audit/how_to_audit_ml_training_metrics_mbe.ipynb
```

Kaggle training scripts and raw result manifests are documented in
[REPRODUCIBILITY.md](https://github.com/AparajeetS/marginal-baseline-eval/blob/master/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) and the large-scale artifact manifest.

## Research Claim

The claim is not that any one metric is universally bad. The claim is narrower
and more useful:

> Raw pooled correlation is insufficient for validating ML training metrics.
> MBE audits whether a metric retains signal beyond ordinary training baselines
> and experimental design variables.

This is a methodological hypothesis under active validation, not a claim that
the current pilot establishes universal metric failure or causal effects.
